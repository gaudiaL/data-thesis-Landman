# data-thesis-Landman
This repository features the primary sources and QualCoder project file used to write my thesis. 
The zip folders contain VTT and txt files of the Netflix subtitle transcripts used as my primary source. The txt files were used during the coding process and the VTT files were used to match the dialogue to the right timestamps. 
The qdpx file is intended to be opened with QualCoder (but should be compatible with most CAQDAS) and contains both the source files and core components such as codes, memos, and cases, using the REFI-QDA Project standard.
